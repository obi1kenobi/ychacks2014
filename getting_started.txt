1. Install heroku toolbelt from https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

  - only Predrag has push privileges on it for now, deploys go from Predrag's computer
2. Install Node.js 0.10
3. Clone repo from https://github.com/obi1kenobi/ychacks2014
4. Run 'npm install'
5. Make an account on firebase.com and run 'npm install -g firebase-tools'
  - our Firebase Hosting domain is https://ychacks.firebaseio.com/
  - let me know what your firebase account name is and I'll give you permissions on it
6. Please use this high-level style to avoid empty-looking git commits -- Predrag can help you set up Sublime to auto-follow most of these rules:
  - use 2 spaces for indentation
  - use Unix style line endings
  - lines do not have trailing whitespace
  - files end in a new line
  - in Coffeescript, do not use parens in such a way that there are lines with only ')' characters -- prefer omitting the parens in that case
